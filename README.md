# Astroid Destroyer Pong

Author: Siheng Li

Design: There are now randomly spawning blocks in the game and the playing
field now shrinks when you hit the opposing wall to increase the difficulty.
Different blocks does different things: red and green provide points for the
corresponding team, yellow doubles the amount of balls, black deletes half
the balls, blue expands the playing field, and grey shrinks it.
